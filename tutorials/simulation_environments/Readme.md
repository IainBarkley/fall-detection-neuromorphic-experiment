# Creating Visualizations and Linking Nengo with Other Environments

In this tutorial you will learn how to create various visualizations within the `nengo_gui` using the HTML plot feature.
Examples will include drawing shapes and images, an agent in a 2D maze environment, and visualizations for spatial semantic pointers.

In the second half of the tutorial I will show how Nengo can interface with arbitrary external simulated environments.
Examples will include environments from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/), the [V-REP](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html) robotics simulator, and communication through [Redis](https://redis.io/).
